# change-tracking-ingestion
Repository for Ops Common Change Tracking Ingestion Infrastructure Setup

## Requirements

* AWS CLI already configured with at least PowerUser permission
* [NodeJS 8.10+ installed](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
* [Docker installed](https://www.docker.com/community-edition)
* [SAM CLI installed](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/sam-cli-requirements.html)

## Setup process

### Local development

** Invoking function locally through local API Gateway**

```bash
sam local start-api
```

If the previous command ran successfully you should now be able to hit the following local endpoint to invoke your function `http://localhost:3000/` and HTTP post a JSON to it.

**SAM CLI** is used to emulate both Lambda and API Gateway locally and uses our `template.yaml` to understand how to bootstrap this environment (runtime, where the source code is, etc.) - The following excerpt is what the CLI will read in order to initialize an API and its routes:

```yaml
...
Events:
    ChangeTrackingIngestion:
        Type: Api # More info about API Event Source: https://github.com/awslabs/serverless-application-model/blob/master/versions/2016-10-31.md#api
        Properties:
            Path: /
            Method: post
```

## Packaging and deployment

AWS Lambda NodeJS runtime requires a flat folder with all dependencies including the application. SAM will use `CodeUri` property to know where to look up for both application and dependencies:

```yaml
...
    ChangeTrackingIngestionFunction:
        Type: AWS::Serverless::Function
        Properties:
            CodeUri: .
            ...
```

Firstly, we need a `S3 bucket` where we can upload our Lambda functions packaged as ZIP before we deploy anything - If you don't have a S3 bucket to store code artifacts then this is a good time to create one:

```bash
aws s3 mb s3://BUCKET_NAME
```

Next, run the following command to package our Lambda function to S3:

```bash
sam package \
    --template-file template.yaml \
    --output-template-file packaged.yaml \
    --s3-bucket REPLACE_THIS_WITH_YOUR_S3_BUCKET_NAME
```

Next, the following command will create a Cloudformation Stack and deploy your SAM resources.

```bash
sam deploy \
    --template-file packaged.yaml \
    --stack-name change-tracking-ingestion \
    --capabilities CAPABILITY_IAM
```

> **See [Serverless Application Model (SAM) HOWTO Guide](https://github.com/awslabs/serverless-application-model/blob/master/HOWTO.md) for more details in how to get started.**

After deployment is complete you can run the following command to retrieve the API Gateway Endpoint URL:

```bash
aws cloudformation describe-stacks \
    --stack-name change-tracking-ingestion \
    --query 'Stacks[].Outputs'
```

## Appendix

### AWS CLI commands

AWS CLI commands to package, deploy and describe outputs defined within the cloudformation stack:

```bash
sam package \
    --template-file template.yaml \
    --output-template-file packaged.yaml \
    --s3-bucket REPLACE_THIS_WITH_YOUR_S3_BUCKET_NAME

sam deploy \
    --template-file packaged.yaml \
    --stack-name change-tracking-ingestion \
    --capabilities CAPABILITY_IAM \
    --parameter-overrides MyParameterSample=MySampleValue

aws cloudformation describe-stacks \
    --stack-name change-tracking-ingestion --query 'Stacks[].Outputs'
```
